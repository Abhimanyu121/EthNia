Most of the tourists comes to the city , visit a few well known places and departs before even getting to see the real ethnicity and the places which does not have well sung sagas for them.

A community of travellers, proof of presence on an awesome place, incentivised support from local people and a review system based on reputation, all these combined would give us an opportunity to get all the nooks and corners of the city explored by tourists.
